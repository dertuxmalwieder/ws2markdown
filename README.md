# WordStar to Markdown

This is a small utility that converts WordStar (*.ws*) into Markdown (*.md*) files.

## Installation

&nbsp;% cargo install ws2markdown

## Usage

&nbsp;% ws2markdown input.ws [output.md]

If you don't provide an input file, a file dialog will appear.
If you don't provide an output file, the resulting Markdown will be printed to *stdout*.

## Examples

This README is a proof that it works.
